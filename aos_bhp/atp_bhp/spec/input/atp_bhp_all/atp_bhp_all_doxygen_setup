# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "SCDS ATP BHP"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = P:\aos_bhp\atp_bhp\spec\output\atp_bhp_all

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# The TAGFILES tag can be used to specify one or more tag files. For each tag
# file the location of the external documentation should be added. The format of
# a tag file without this location is as follows:
# TAGFILES = file1 file2 ...
# Adding location for the tag files is done as follows:
# TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ...
# where loc1 and loc2 can be relative or absolute paths or URLs. See the
# section "Linking to external documentation" for more information about the use
# of tag files.
# Note: Each tag file must have a unique name (where the name does NOT include
# the path). If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen is
# run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. To create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. You can
# optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted DoxygenLayout.xml
# will be used as the name of the layout file.
#
# Note that if you run doxygen from a directory containing a file called
# DoxygenLayout.xml, doxygen will parse it automatically even if the LAYOUT_FILE
# tag is left empty.
