Most error messages have an associated error number.  By looking up the
number in the list below you can obtain additional information about the
cause of the error.  This information is also available from a
self-extracting executable msg.exe, found on the PC-lint distribution
diskette, which produces the machine-readable ASCII file msg.txt.  For
FlexeLint users, the file msg.txt can be found on the FlexeLint
Supplementary diskette.

Messages numbered 1000 and higher pertain generally to C++.  This is
summarized in the table below.

After a possible 1000 is subtracted off, the remainder lies in the range
0-999.  Remainders in the range 1-199 are syntax errors, 200-299 are
PC-lint/FlexeLint internal errors and should never occur, 300-399 are
fatal errors usually brought about by exceeding some limit, 400-699 are
warning messages that indicate that something is likely to be wrong with
the program being examined.  Remainders in the range 700-899 designate
informational messages.  These may be errors but they also may represent
legitimate programming practices depending upon personal programming
style.  Remainders in the range 900-999 are called "Elective Notes".
They are not automatically output.  You may examine the list to see if
you wish to be alerted to any of them.  Lint also provides an additional
set of elective notes in the 9000 range to help support various coding
guidelines.  Like the traditional Elective Notes, these messages are not
automatically outputted.

                                Glossary

A few of the terms used in the commentary below are:

argument  The actual argument of a function as opposed to a dummy (or
          formal) parameter of a function (see parameter).

arithmetic Any of the integral types (see below) plus float, double, and
           long double.

Boolean   In general, the word Boolean refers to quantities that can be
          either true or false.  An expression is said to be Boolean
          (perhaps it would be better to say 'definitely Boolean') if it
          is of the form: operand op operand where op is a relational (&gt;
          &gt;= &lt; &lt;=), an equality operator (== !=), logical And (&amp;&amp;) or
          logical Or (||).  A context is said to require a Boolean if it
          is used in an if or while clause or if it is the 2nd
          expression of a for clause or if it is an argument to one of
          the operators:  &amp;&amp; or ||.  An expression needn't be definitely
          Boolean to be acceptable in a context that requires a Boolean.
          Any integer or pointer is acceptable.

declaration Gives properties about an object or function (as opposed to
            a definition).

definition That which allocates space for an object or function (as
           opposed to a declaration) and which may also indicate
           properties about the object.  There should be only one
           definition for an object but there may be many declarations.

integral  A type that has properties similar to integers.  These include
          char, short, int, and long and the unsigned variations of any
          of these.

scalar    Any of the arithmetic types plus pointers.

lvalue    Is an expression that can be used on the Left hand side of an
          assignment operator (=).  Some contexts require lvalues such
          as autoincrement (++) and autodecrement (--).

macro     An abbreviation defined by a #define statement.  It may or may
          not have arguments.

member    Elements of a struct and of a union are called members.

module    That which is compiled by a compiler in a single independent
          compilation.  It typically includes all the text of a .c (or a
          .cpp or .cxx, etc.) file plus any text within any #include
          file(s).

parameter A formal parameter of a function as opposed to an actual
          argument (see argument).


                           Message Parameters

Some of the messages are parameterized with one or more of the following
italicized names:

Char      Some character

Context   Specifies one of several contexts in which an assignment can
          be made.  Can be one of:

     o    assignment -- refers to an explicit assignment operator.
     o    return -- refers to the implied assignment of a return
          statement. The type of the expression is converted implicitly
          to the type of the function.
     o    initialization -- refers to the assignment implied by an
          initialization statement.
     o    arg. no.... -- refers to the implied assignment of an argument
          in the presence of a prototype.  The type of the expression is
          implicitly converted to the type within a prototype.
     o    arg. 'this' -- refers to the implied argument of a member
          function call.


FileName  A filename.  Messages containing this parameter can be
          suppressed with the -efile( ... ) option.

Integer   Some integer

Invocation A function call with argument types.  To suppress a message
           containing an Invocation you need the complete call, not just
           the function name.  For example, the call f(1) could result
           in Error 1024 parameterized by 'f(int)'.  To suppress this
           message you could use -esym(1024,f(int)).  You could also use
           wild cards as in -esym(1024,f*).

Kind      A list of control structures.

Location  A line number followed optionally by a filename (if different
          from the current) and/or a module name if different from the
          current.

Name      A string, usually an identifier, that can be suppressed with a
          -esym but not with -elibsym.

String    A sequence of characters identified further in the message
          description.

Symbol    The name of a user identifier referring to a C or C++ object
          such as variable, function, structure, etc.  Messages
          containing this parameter can be suppressed with the -esym(
          ... ) option.  For C++, if Symbol is the name of a function
          the full function signature (including parameters) is given.
          Error suppression with -esym does not require (nor want) the
          parameters.

Type      A type or a top type base is provided.  A top type base is one
          of pointer, function, array, struct, union, or enum.

TypeDiff  Specifies the way in which one type differs from another.
          Because of type qualification, function prototypes, and type
          compounding, it may not be obvious how two types differ.
          Also, see the -etd option to inhibit errors based on type
          differences.  TypeDiff can be one or more of:

     o    basic -- The two types differ in some fundamental way such as
          double versus int.

     o    count -- Two function types differ in the number of arguments.

     o    ellipsis -- Two function types differ in that one is
          prototyped using an ellipsis and the other is not prototyped.
          See <section,15.8,plain vanilla="" functions="">.

     o    incomplete -- At least one of the types is only partially
          specified such as an array without a dimension or a function
          without a prototype.

     o    nominal -- The types are nominally different but are otherwise
          the same.  For example, int versus long where these are the
          same size or double versus long double where these are the
          same size.  The two types are either both integral or both
          float or are functions that return types or have arguments
          that differ nominally.  If long is the same size as int then
          unsigned long will differ from int both as nominal and as
          signed/unsigned.  If not the same size, then the difference is
          precision.

     o    origin -- The types are not actually different but have
          different origins.  For example a struct is defined in two
          separate modules rather than in one header file.  If for some
          reason you want to do this then use the option -etd(origin).

     o    precision -- Two arithmetic types differ in their precision
          such as int vs. long where these are different sizes.

     o    promotion -- Two function types differ in that one is
          prototyped with a char, short or float type and the other is
          not prototyped.

     o    ptrs to... -- Pointers point to different types, some TypeDiff
          code follows.

     o    ptrs to incompatible types -- Pointers point to types which in
          turn differ in precision, count, size, ellipsis or promotion.

     o    qualification -- Qualifiers such as const, volatile, etc. are
          inconsistent.

     o    signed/unsigned -- The types differ in that one is a signed
          integral type and the other is unsigned of the same size, or
          they are both functions that return types that differ in this
          way, or they are both pointers to types that differ in this
          way.

     o    size -- Two arrays differ in array dimension.

     o    strong -- two types differ in that one is strong and the other
          is not the same strong type.

     o    void/nonvoid -- The two types differ in that one is void and
          the other is not or, more frequently, they are both functions
          returning types that differ in this respect or pointers to
          types that differ in this respect.

     o    int/enum-- One type is an enum and the other is an int.

     o    Type = Type -- The two types in an assignment of some kind
          differ in some basic way and no more information is available.

     o    Type vs. Type -- The two types differ in some basic way and no
          more information is available.

<td><pre>   Bypass header 'Name' follows a different header sequence than in
      module 'String' which includes File1 where the current module
      includes File2 -- This message is issued when a header is
      #include'd that had previously been designated as bypass and it
      has been determined that this header follows a different header
      include sequence than in some other module.  The name of the
      other module is given by the second parameter of this message.
      In order not to bury the programmer under a ton of header names,
      we have made an effort to determine the precise point where the
      two modules went their separate ways.  The first include file
      difference occurred when that other module included the header
      identified by File1, whereas the current module was attempting to
      include the header identified by File2.  Each Filei is a pair of
      parameters of the form 'String' (Location) where the location is
      the point of the #include.

      For example:
     
                Module x.cpp:
                    #include "alpha.h"
                    #include "delta.h"
                    #include "beta.h"
                    #include "gamma.h"

                Module y.cpp:
                    #include "alpha.h"
                    #include "beta.h"
                    #include "gamma.h"
     
      When the include of "beta.h" occurs in module y.cpp (and if
      beta.h has been designated as bypass), there will be a Fatal
      Error 328 that the header sequence of module 'x.cpp' differs from
      the current module in that the former module included 'delta.h'
      at a point where the current module included 'beta.h'.

      It was necessary to make this message a fatal error since
      attempting to bypass headers that do not follow a consistent
      header sequence is an act of folly.  It is possible to continue
      on after the 328 in hopes of picking up more inconsistencies in
      other modules.  This can be done using the +fce
      (Continue-on-Error) flag.

      systems) the warning is issued based upon the sign bit.  If long
      is larger than an int (as is true on typical 16-bit systems) the
      warning is issued if the value was a converted negative as in the
      examples above.  It is not issued if an unsigned int has the
      high-order bit set.  This is because it is not unreasonable to
      malloc more that 32,176 bytes in a 16-bit system.

      The kind of data (specified by String2) is one or more of:
      malloc, new, new[], static, auto, member, modified or constant.
      These have the meanings as described below:

      malloc    data is data obtained from a call to malloc, calloc or
                realloc.
      new and new[]  data is data derived from calls to new.
      static    data is either static data within a function or
                external data.
      auto      data is non-static data in a function.
      member    data is a component of a structure (and hence can't be
                independently freed).
      modified  data is the result of applying pointer arithmetic to
                some other pointer.  E.g.
       
                    p = malloc(100);
                    free( p+1 );    // warning

                p+1 is considered modified.
      constant  data is the result of casting a constant to a pointer.
                E.g.
       
                    int *p = (int *) Ox80002;

<td><pre>   Custodial pointer 'Symbol' (Location) has not been freed or
      returned -- A pointer of auto storage class was allocated storage
      which was neither freed nor returned to the caller.  This
      represents a "memory leak".  A pointer is considered custodial if
      it uniquely points to the storage area.  It is not considered
      custodial if it has been copied.  Thus:
     
            int *p = new int[20];  // p is a custodial pointer
            int *q = p;            // p is no longer custodial
            p = new int[20];       // p again becomes custodial
            q = p + 0;             // p remains custodial

      Here p does not lose its custodial property by merely
      participating in an arithmetic operation.

      A pointer can lose its custodial property by passing the pointer
      to a function.  If the parameter of the function is typed pointer
      to const or if the function is a library function, that
      assumption is not made.  For example
     
            p = malloc(10);
            strcpy (p, "hello");

      Then p still has custody of storage allocated.

      It is possible to indicate via semantic options that a function
      will take custody of a pointer.

<td><pre>   Two execution paths are being combined with different mutex lock
      states -- It is the purpose of this message to make absolutely
      certain that every lock has a corresponding unlock in the same
      unbroken sequence of code in the same function.

      Execution paths can be combined at the end of an if statement,
      switch statement, or the begining of while, for and do
      statements, a label (target of goto), etc.  In all these cases we
      check to make sure that the mutex lock states are the same.  For
      example:
     
              //lint -sem( lock, thread_lock )
              void f( bool x )
                  {
                  if( x ) lock();
                  // Warning 456 issued here
                  ...
     
      It could be argued that if an unlock() call would appear under
      control of the very same bool x in the example above then all
      would be well.  And if this is your coding style you are free to
      turn this message off.  But errors in mutex locking have such
      horrible programming consequences as to suggest especially strong
      measures to assure code correctness.  We recommend, for example:
     
              //lint -sem( lock, thread_lock )
              //lint -sem( unlock, thread_unlock )
              void f( bool x )
                  {
                  if( x )
                      { lock(); /* something */; unlock(); }
                  else
                      { /* something */ }
                  }
     
      If the 'something' that is being executed is sufficently complex,
      then it can be made into a function.

      If a function's address is taken, we presume that we are unable
      to determine statically all the locations from which the function
      may be called and so we presume that any and all threads can call
      this function and so the function needs to have protected access
      to every static variable that it might touch.

      There are several remedies to such a message.  If multiple
      threads can indeed access this function, then place a mutex lock
      in the function.  If there already is a mutex lock and we don't
      recognize it, then set the thread_protected semantic for the
      function.  If only one thread really accesses this function or if
      the access is guaranteed to be benign, then, after making sure
      this condition is commented in the code, use the same
      thread_protected semantic for the function.

      valid if the type can accomodate 5*(2**n).  This is equivalent to

      obtain a different result than if n were first evaluated and then

      The programmer should generally rewrite these expressions so that
      the compiler is constrained to use the intended order.  For
      example if the programmer wanted to use the n prior to the call

<td><pre>   Increase in pointer capability (Context) -- This warning is
      typically caused by assigning a (pointer to const) to an ordinary
      pointer.  For example:
     
            int *p;
            const int *q;
            p = q;      /* 605 */
     
      The message will be inhibited if a cast is used as in:

            p = (int *) q;

      An increase in capability is indicated because the const pointed
      to by q can now be modified through p.  This message can be given
      for the volatile qualifier as well as the const qualifier and may
      be given for arbitrary pointer depths (pointers to pointers,
      pointers to arrays, etc.).

      If the number of pointer levels exceeds one, things get murky in
      a hurry.  For example:
     
            const char ** ppc;
            char ** pp;
            pp = ppc;        /* 605 - clearly not safe */
            ppc = pp;        /* 605 - looks safe but it's not */
     
      It was not realized by the C community until very recently that
      assigning pp to ppc was dangerous.  The problem is that after the
      above assignment, a pointer to a const char can be assigned
      indirectly through ppc and accessed through pp which can then
      modify the const char.

      The message speaks of an "increase in capability" in assigning to
      ppc, which seems counter intuitive because the indirect pointer
      has less capability.  However, assigning the pointer does not
      destroy the old one and the combination of the two pointers
      represents a net increase in capability.

      The message may also be given for function pointer assignments
      when the prototype of one function contains a pointer of higher
      capability than a corresponding pointer in another prototype.
      There is a curious inversion here whereby a prototype of lower
      capability translates into a function of greater trust and hence
      greater capability (a Trojan Horse).  For example, let

            void warrior( char * );

      be a function that destroys its argument.  Consider the function:

            void Troy( void (*horse)(const char *) );

      Troy( ) will call horse( ) with an argument that it considers
      precious believing the horse( ) will do no harm.  Before
      compilers knew better and believing that adding in a const to the
      destination never hurt anything, earlier compilers allowed the
      Greeks to pass warrior( ) to Troy and the rest, as they say, is
      history.

      that there may have been an unintended loss of information during
      an operation involving int or unsigned int the result of which is
      later converted to long.  It is issued only for systems in which
      int is smaller than long.  For example:

            (long) (n &lt;&lt; 8)

      might elicit this message if n is unsigned int, whereas

            (long) n &lt;&lt; 8

      would not.  In the first case, the shift is done at int precision
      and the high order 8 bits are lost even though there is a
      subsequent conversion to a type that might hold all the bits.  In
      the second case, the shifted bits are retained.

      The operations that are scrutinized and reported upon by this
      message are:  shift left, multiplication, and bit-wise
      complementation.  Addition and subtraction are covered by
      Informational message 776.

      The conversion to long may be done explicitly with a cast as
      shown or implicitly via assignment, return, argument passing or
      initialization.

      The message can be suppressed by casting.  You may cast one of
      the operands so that the operation is done in full precision as
      is given by the second example above.  Alternatively, if you
      decide there is really no problem here (for now or in the
      future), you may cast the result of the operation to some form of
      int.  For example, you might write:

          (long) (unsigned) (n &lt;&lt; 8)

      In this way PC-lint/FlexeLint will know you are aware of and
      approve of the truncation.

<td><pre>   Overflow in computing constant for operation: String --
      Arithmetic overflow was detected while computing a constant
      expression.  For example, if int is 16 bits then 200 * 200 will
      result in an overflow. String gives the operation that caused the
      overflow and may be one of: addition, unsigned addition,
      multiplication, unsigned multiplication, negation, shift left,
      unsigned shift left, subtraction, or unsigned sub.

      To suppress this message for particular constant operations you
      may have to supply explicit truncation.  For example, if you want
      to obtain the low order 8 bits of the integer 20000 into the high
      byte of a 16-bit int, shifting left would cause this warning.
      However, truncating first and then shifting would be OK.  The
      following code illustrates this where int is 16 bits.
     
           20000u &lt;&lt; 8;                  /* 648 */
           (0xFF &amp; 20000u) &lt;&lt; 8;         /* OK  */
     
      If you truncate with a cast you may make a signed expression out
      of an unsigned.  For example, the following receives a warning
      (for 16 bit int).

           (unsigned char) OxFFFu &lt;&lt; 8       /* 648 */

      because the unsigned char is promoted to int before shifting.
      The resulting quantity is actually negative.  You would need to
      revive the unsigned nature of the expression with

           (unsigned) (unsigned char) OxFFF &lt;&lt; 8     /* OK */

      char variable, this warning will be issued.  Moreover, if char is
      signed (and 8 bits) you will get this message if you compare
      against an integer greater than 127.  The problem can be fixed
      with a cast.  For example:

           if( ch == 0xFF ) ...
           if( (unsigned char) ch == 0xFF ) ...

      If char is signed (+fcu has not been set) the first receives a

      and corrects the bug.

      PC-lint/FlexeLint will take into account the limited precision of
      some operands such as bit-fields and enumerated types.  Also,
      PC-lint/FlexeLint will take advantage of some computations that
      limit the precision of an operand.  For example,

           if( (n &amp; 0xFF) &gt;&gt; 4 == 16 ) ...

      considered suspicious for one of a variety of reasons.  The
      reason is designated by a reason code that is specified by Name.
      At this writing the following reasons for issuing this message
      exist:

      o  unbalanced quotes -- An option was seen with a quote character
      which was not balanced within that same option.

      o  backtick preceding non-meta character is superfluous and has
      been dropped -- A backtick (`) was seen before a character other
      than a * or a ?. The use of a backtick in this fashion has no
      effect.

      o  Upper case characters within extension 'String'; these will
      match lower case when +fff is on; try -fff -- A file extension
      involving capital letters was seen in a +cpp(), +lnt(), or +ext()
      option while the +fff flag was active. If, for example, you
      intend for .c to indicate a C module and .C to indicate a C++
      module, turning off the fff flag will help avoid unnecessary
      complaints from Lint.

      o  extraneous characters following String -- One or more
      characters were seen immediately following a character which is
      expected to signify the end of an option, such as a closing right
      parenthesis. While the extraneous characters are ignored, their
      presence may indicate a typographical error.

      o  missing field-specifier in a non-empty format string [No data
      will be generated for this category.] -- A -program_info() option
      was expecting a field-specifier which was actually missing. As
      noted, no data for this particular category will be generated.

      o  the likelihood of causing meaningless output -- An option,
      such as -elib(*), -wlib(0), or +fce was seen; this typically
      hides a problem in the Lint configuration. When using a new Lint
      configuration, it's common for a user to encounter Error messages
      from Lint about library header code. (This usually does not
      indicate a problem with library headers.) For example, a
      misconfiguration of Lint's preprocessor is by far the most common
      source of these errors.  If you merely suppress basic Syntax
      Errors (like Error 10) and/or Fatal Errors (like Error 309), the
      underlying Lint configuration problem still exists; as a result,
      Lint will fail to parse your code correctly (because your code
      depends on the aforementioned library code). The output from Lint
      would then seem illogical and/or meaningless. Therefore, blanket
      suppression options like this are highly discouraged.  Instead,
      other aspects of the Lint configuration should be modified to
      make Lint's behavior more similar to that of the compiler at (or,
      typically, before) the point of the Error.

      o  a lack of an argument -- A -message() was found to not include
      text between the parentheses, rendering the option meaningless.
      Did the User possibly intend to include the text immediately
      after this option?

      For example:

      the pointers is a generic pointer (neither is pointer to char,
      unsigned char, or void) and the indirect types are truly
      different.  The message will not be given if the indirect types
      differ merely in signedness (e.g., pointer to unsigned versus
      pointer to int) or in qualification (e.g., pointer to const int
      versus pointer to int).  The message will also not be given if
      one of the indirect types is a union.

      The main purpose of this message is to report possible problems
      for machines in which pointer to char is rendered differently
      from pointer to word.  Consider casting a pointer to pointer to
      char to a pointer to pointer to word.  The indirect bit pattern
      remains unchanged.

      A second reason is to identify those pointer casts in which the
      indirect type doesn't seem to have the proper bit pattern such as
      casting from a pointer to int to a pointer to double.

      If you are not interested in running on machines in which char
      pointers are fundamentally different from other pointers then you
      may want to suppress this message.  You can also suppress this
      message by first casting to char pointer or to void pointer but
      this is only recommended if the underlying semantics are right.

      Another example of a statement that will yield this message is:

            p = new (char *) [n];

      This is a gruesome blunder on the part of the programmer.  It
      does NOT allocate an array of pointers as a novice might think.
      It is parsed as:

            p = (new (char *)) [n];

      which represents an allocation of a single pointer followed by an
      index into this 'array' of one pointer.

      Most bit fields are more useful when they are unsigned.  If you
      want to have a signed bit field you must explicitly indicate this
      as follows:
     
              signed int a:5;
     
      The same also holds for typedef's.  For example,
     
              typedef int INT;
              typedef signed int SINT;
              struct  {

                      }:
     
      It is very unusual in C or C++ to distinguish between signed int
      and just plain int.  This is one of those rare cases.

<td><pre>   Worst case function for stack usage: String -- This message,
      issued at global wrap-up, will report on the function that
      requires the most stack.  The stack required consists of the
      amount of auto storage the function requires plus the amounts
      required in any chain of functions called.  The worst case chain
      is always reported.

      To obtain a report of all the function use the option
      -ok(filename).

      Reasonable allowances are made for function call overhead and the
      stack requirements of external functions.  These assumptions can
      be controlled via the -stack option.

      If recursion is detected it will be reported here as this is
      considered worse than any finite case.  The next worse case is
      that the stack can't be determined because a function makes a
      call through a function pointer.  The function is said to be
      non-deterministic.  If neither if these conditions prevail, the
      function that heads the worst case chain of calls will be
      reported upon.

      The message will normally provide you with the name of a called
      function.  If the function is recursive this will provide you
      with the first call of a recursive loop.  To determine the full
      loop, use option -ok(filename) which will contain a record for
      each function for which a definition was found.  You will be able
      to follow the chain of calls to determine the recursive path.

      If you can assure yourself through code analysis that there is an
      upper bound to the amount of stack utilized by some recursive
      function then you can employ the -stack option to specify this
      bound.  The function will no longer be considered recursive but
      rather finite.  In this way, possibly through a sequence of
      options, you can progressively eliminate apparent recursion and
      in that way arrive at a safe upper bound for stack usage.
      Similar considerations apply for non-deterministic functions.

      This message is delivered after the for loop has been completed.

      A for loop with an identifiable loop index variable was
      programmed in such a way that the loop body also modifies the
      index variable.  For example:
     
              for( i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++ )
                  {
                  a[i++] = 0;
                  }
     
      In general it is better to restrict modifications to for loop
      index variables to the for clause if at all possible.  If this is
      not possible, you can prefix the for loop with an appropriate
      lint comment such as:
     
              /*lint -e{850} i is modified in the body of the for loop */
     
      The message is parameterized with a type category which is one
      of:

        float some form of floating point number
        string some form of char * including wide char
        pointer some form of pointer other than string
        enumeration an enumeration of some kind
        unclassified none of the above

      This will allow you to be more selective in the delivery of
      messages because you may suppress or enable messages according to
      these classifications.  For example:
     
            -e850
            +estring(850,integral)
            +estring(850,float)

      other forms of loop variables.

<td><pre>   Expression involving variable 'Symbol' possibly depends on order
      of evaluation -- The variable cited in the message is either
      passed to a reference that is not a const reference or its
      address is passed to a pointer that is not a pointer to const.
      Hence the variable is potentially modified by the function.  If
      the same variable is used elsewhere in the same expression, then
      the result may depend on the order of evaluation of the
      expression.  For example:
     
              int g( int );
              int h( int &amp; );
              int f( int k )
                  {
                  return g(k) + h(k);   // Info 864
                  }
     
      Here the compiler is free to evaluate the call to g() first with
      the original value of k and then call h() where k gets modified.
      Alternatively, it can, with equal validity, call h() first in
      which case the value passed to g() would be the new value.

      The object being modified could be the implicit argument (the
      this argument) to a member function call. For example:
     
              void f( int, int );
              class X { public: int bump(); int k; };
              ...
              X x;
              f( x.bump(), x.bump() );  // Info 864
     
      Here the message states that the expression involving object x
      possibly depends on the order of evaluation.  x is an implicit
      argument (by reference) to the bump() member function.  If the
      member function bump() were declared const then the message would
      not have been emitted.

        int f( char *p, int n ) { return *p = n; }

      can be redeclared as:

        int f( char * const p, const int n ) { return *p = n; }

      There are few advantages to declaring an unchanging parameter a
      const.  It signals to the person reading the code that a
      parameter is unchanging, but, in the estimate of most, reduces
      legibility.  For this reason the message has been given an
      Elective Note status.

      However, there is a style of programming that encourages
      declaring parameters const.  For the above example, this style
      would declare f as

          int f( char * p, int n);

      and would use the const qualifier only in the definition.  Note
      that the two forms are compatible according to the standard.  The
      declaration is considered the interface specification where the
      const's do not matter.  The const's do matter in the definition
      of the function which is considered the implementation.  Message
      952 could be used to support this style.

      Marking a parameter as const does not affect the type of argument
      that can be passed to the parameter.  In particular, it does not
      mean that only const arguments may be passed.  This is in
      contrast to declaring a parameter as pointer to const or
      reference to const.  For these situations, Informational messages
      are issued (818 and 1764 respectively) and these do affect the
      kinds of arguments that may be passed.  See also messages 953 and
      954.

            for( ; *p; p++ ) print(*p);

      This check has been advocated by programmers whose applications
      are multi-threaded.  Software that contains modifiable data of

      threads cannot run the code concurrently.  By 'static duration'
      we mean variables declared static or variables declared external
      to any function.  For example:
     
            int count = 0;
            void bump( ) { count++; }
            void get_count( ) { return count; }

      If the purpose is to obtain a count of all the bump( )'s by a
      given thread then this program clearly will not do since the
      global variable count sums up the bump( )'s from all the threads.
      Moreover, if the purpose of the code is to obtain a count of all
      bump( )'s by all threads, it still may contain a subtle error
      (depending on the compiler and the machine).  If it is possible
      to interrupt a thread between the access of count and the
      subsequent store, then two threads that are bump( )'ing at the
      same time, may register an increase in the count by just one.

      Please note that not all code is intended to be re-entrant.  In
      fact most programs are not designed that way and so this Elective
      Note need not be enabled for the majority of programs.  If the
      program is intended to be re-entrant, all uses of non-const

      compiler ensures that each structure is allocated at an address
      with the proper alignment.  This will require padding if the size
      of the structure is not an even multiple of its maximum
      alignment.  For example:
     
          struct A { int n; char ch; } a[10];
     
      Assuming the size and alignment of int is 4 then the size of each
      struct is 5 but its alignment is 4.  As a result each struct in
      the array will be padded with 3 bytes.

      Alignment can vary with the compiler and the machine.  If binary
      data is to be shared by separately compiled modules, it is safer
      to make sure that all shared structures and unions are explicitly
      padded.

              extern const char *p;
              extern char const *p;   // Note 963
     
      The qualifier 'const' and 'volatile' may appear either before or
      after or even between other declaration specifiers.  Many
      programmers prefer a consistent scheme such as always placing the
      qualifier before the type.  If you enable 963 (using +e963) this
      is what you will get by default.  The message will contain the
      word 'follows' rather than the word 'precedes'.

      There is a diametrically opposite convention, viz. that of
      placing the qualifier after the type.  As the message itself
      reminds the user you will obtain the reverse test if you turn off
      the fqb (place qualifiers before types) flag.  Thus
     
              //lint -fqb   turn off the Qualifiers Before types flag
              //lint +e963  report on type-qualifier inversion
              extern const char *p;   // Note 963
              extern char const *p;
     
      Note that the use of this flag will cause 'follows' in the
      message to be replaced by 'precedes' and the alternative option
      mentioned within the 'use' clause is changed to its opposite
      orientation.

      Dan Saks [36] and Vandevoorde and Josuttis [32, section 1.4]
      (<ref,14. added="" bibliography,14.="">), provide convincing evidence
      that this alternative convention is indeed the better one.

<td><pre>   Worst case function for stack usage: String -- This message,
      issued at global wrap-up, will report on the function that
      requires the most stack.  The stack required consists of the
      amount of auto storage the function requires plus the amounts
      required in any chain of functions called.  The worst case chain
      is always reported.

      To obtain a report of all the functions, use the +stack option.

      Reasonable allowances are made for function call overhead and the
      stack requirements of external functions.  These assumptions can
      be controlled via the +stack option.

      If recursion is detected it will be reported here, as this is
      considered worse than any finite case.  The next worse case is
      that the stack can't be determined because a function makes a
      call through a function pointer.  The function is said to be
      non-deterministic.  If neither of these conditions prevail, the
      function that heads the worst case chain of calls will be
      reported upon.

      The message will normally provide you with the name of a called
      function.  If the function is recursive this will provide you
      with the first call of a recursive loop.  To determine the full
      loop, you will need a full stack report as obtained with the
      +stack option.  You need a suboption of the form &amp;file=file to
      specify a file which will contain a record for each function for
      which a definition was found.  You will be able to follow the
      chain of calls to determine the recursive path.

      If you can assure yourself through code analysis that there is an
      upper bound to the amount of stack utilized by some recursive
      function, then you can employ the +stack option to specify the
      bound for this function.  The function will no longer be
      considered recursive but rather finite.  In this way, possibly
      through a sequence of options, you can progressively eliminate
      apparent recursion and in that way arrive at a safe upper bound
      for stack usage.  Similar considerations apply for
      non-deterministic functions.

      If the name is unrecognized then the remainder of the line is

<td><pre>  Effective type 'Type' of non-type template parameter #Integer
      (corresponding to argument expression 'String') depends on an
      unspecialized parameter of this partial specialization -- The ISO
      C++ Standard says that "the type of a template parameter
      corresponding to a specialized non-type argument shall not be
      dependent on a parameter of the specialization." See Section
      <ref,14. added="" bibliography,14.="">, [34], 14.5.4 temp.class.spec.
      Example:
     
          // primary template:
          template<class t,="" t="" n,="" class="" u=""> struct B;

          // PS #1:

          // PS #2:
          template<class u=""> struct B<bool,257,u>; // Ok, same as:
          template<class u=""> struct B<bool,true,u>; // Ok (redeclaration of #2)

          // PS #3:
          template<class u=""> struct B<t,257,u>; // Error 1095 here
     
      In PS #3, the value 257 is the 'specialized non-type argument'
      and its corresponding parameter is 'N' whose type is T which was
      not made concrete.  But in PS #1 and PS #2, T was given the
      concrete types 'int' and 'bool', respectively.

          // #1 does not match but #2 does.

      more function templates, e.g. with boost::enable_if.

              // template &lt;&gt;  // Would be ill-formed by ISO C++.

          };
          template&lt;&gt; struct A::B<int> {}; // Ok.
     
      There is an additional limitation with member class templates of
      class templates.  As with members of a non-template class, one
      cannot write a specialization at class scope.   Example:
     
          template<typename t=""> struct G {
              template <typename u=""> struct H {};
              // template &lt;&gt;  // Would be ill-formed by ISO C++.
              //     struct H<int> {};
          };
     
      But the language specification does not even allow this to be
      expressed in a namespace-scope definition; there is no way to
      write an explicit specialization that is a member of a class
      template.  Example:
     
          template<typename t=""> struct J {
              template <typename u=""> struct K {};
          };
          // template<typename t="">
          //     template &lt;&gt;  // Would be ill-formed by ISO C++;
          //         struct J<t>::K<int> {};
     
      This is because the rules for explicit specializations say that
      'template&lt;&gt;' is not allowed to appear after a non-empty
      template-parameter-list within the same declaration.  However,
      one may write an explicit specialization that is a member of an
      implicitly-instantiated specialization of a class template.
      Example:
     
          template<typename t=""> struct L {
              template <typename u=""> struct M {};
          };
          template &lt;&gt; template &lt;&gt; struct L<char>::M<int> {}; // Ok
     
      Here, the body of the class L<char> is automatically generated by
      implicit instantiation (otherwise the reference to 'L<char>::M'
      would be ill-formed), while the body of L<char>::M<int> is
      provided in the explicit specialization.

      In March of 2009, the ISO C++ committee reviewed a report
      submitted against this example:
     
         struct A {
            template<class t=""> struct B;
            template <class t=""> struct B<t*> { }; // well-formed
            template &lt;&gt; struct B<int*> { }; // ill-formed
          };
     
      While it might seem odd that one is able to write the partial
      specialization but not the full specialization, the committee
      (which at the time was in a "feature-freeze" mode and trying to
      finalize a draft for the next International Standard) decided
      that this capability would need to be regarded as an "extension",
      meaning that it could be considered as a new feature in a future
      standard but not as a bug-fix for C++0x.

      Note that the Microsoft compiler implements this extension.  For
      that reason, the Lint option
     
          -elib(1111)
     
      appears in recent versions of our configuration files for
      Microsoft compilers.

      Whereas addresses are completely known at initialization time
      values may not be.  Whether the value or merely the address of a
      variable is used in the initialization of a second variable is
      not an easy thing to determine when an argument is passed by

            X x1 = x2;

      It is theoretically possible, but unlikely, that the constructor
      X( ) is interested only in the address of its argument and not
      its current value.  If so, it only means you will be getting a
      spurious report which you can suppress based on variable name.
      However, if the const is missing when passing a reference
      parameter (or a pointer parameter) then we cannot easily assume
      that values are being used.  In this case no report will be
      issued.  The moral is that if you want to get the checking
      implied by this message you should make your constructor
      reference arguments const.

          h(p);
     
      It might seem that passing a regular (i.e., non-const) pointer to
      a const int * could cause no harm.  That would be correct if it
      were not for the reference.  If function h() were to assign a
      pointer to const to its parameter q then upon return from the
      call, p could be used to modify const data.

      There are many subtle cases that can boggle the mind.  See the
      commentary to Message 605.

      A call to function f that contained an argument of type X::A

      Some designers adopt the strategy of embedding the class within a

      available to users of the original namespace.  For example:
     
          namespace X

              template&lt; class T &gt;

              using X1::A;

      Experts [24] recommend that a pair of functions be made available

            class X
                {

                };

      In this way, if the object is const then only the const function
      will be called which will return the protected reference.

              A<int>
              A<a<int>&gt;
              A<a<a<int>&gt;&gt;
              ...
     
      Using the -vt option (turning on template verbosity) you will see
      the sequence in action.  Accordingly we have devised a scheme to
      break the recursion when an arbitrary depth of recursion has been
      reached (at this writing 75).  This depth is reported in the
      message.  As the message suggests, this limit can be adjusted so
      that it equals some other value.

      When the limit is reached, a complete type is not used in the
      definition of the last specialization in the sequence but
      processing goes on.  The message can be suppressed in most cases
      with no ill effects.

      following.  Did the programmer forget to append a semi-colon? The
      problem with this is that the next expression is then consumed as
      part of the return statement.  Your return might be doing more
      that you thought.  For example:
     
              void f( int n, int m )
                  {
                  if( n &lt; 0 ) return // do not print when n is negative

      probably not what you intended.  Instead of printing n and m, for
      n not negative you print just m.  For n negative you print n.

      To avoid this problem always follow the return keyword with

      expression.

<td><pre>  Assignment operator for class 'Symbol' does not return a const
      reference to class -- The typical use of an assignment operator
      for class C is to assign new information to variables of class C.
      If this were the entire story there would be no need for the
      assignment operator to return anything.  However, it is
      conventional to support chains of assignment as in:
     
              C x, y, z;
              ...
              x = y = z;
              // parsed as x = (y = z);
     
      For this reason assignment normally returns a reference to the
      object assigned the value.  For example, assignment (y = z) would
      return a reference to y.

      Since it is almost never the case that this variable is to be
      reassigned, i.e. we almost never wish to write:
     
              (x = y) = z;    // unusual
     
      as a general rule it is better to make the assignment operator
      return a const reference.  This will generate a warning when the
      unusual case is attempted.

      But experts differ.  Some maintain that in order to support
      non-const member functions operating directly on the result of an
      assignment as in:
     
              (x = y).mangle();
     
      where, as its name suggests, mangle is non-const it would be
      necessary for the return value of assignment to be non-const.
      Others would argue that this code could easily be replaced by a
      pair of expressions but if you want to support this style of
      programming then you should suppress this message.

<td><pre>  While calling 'Symbol': Initializing the implict object parameter
      'Type' (a non-const reference) with a non-lvalue -- A non-static
      and non-const member function was called and an rvalue (a
      temporary object) of class type was used to initialize the
      implicit object parameter.  This is legal (and possibly
      intentional) but suspicious.  Consider the following.
     
              struct A { void f(); };
              ...
              A().f();          // Info 1793
              ...
     
      In the above the 'non-static, non-const member function' is
      A::f().  The 'implicit object parameter' for the call to A::f()
      is A(), a temporary.  Since the A::f() is non-const it presumably
      modifies A().  But since A() is a temporary, any such change is
      lost.  It would at first blush appear to be a mistake.

      The Standard normally disallows binding a non-const reference to
      an rvalue (see Error 1058 in the manual), but as a special case
      allows it for the binding of the implicit object parameter in
      member function calls.  Some popular libraries take advantage of
      this rule in a legitimate way.  For example, the GNU
      implementation of std::vector<bool>::operator[] returns a
      temporary object of type std::_Bit_reference -- a class type with
      a non-const member operator=().  _Bit_reference serves a dual
      purpose.  If a value is assigned to it, it modifies the original
      class through its operator=().  If a value is extracted from it,
      it obtains that value from the original class through its
      operator bool().

      Probably the best policy to take with this message is to examine
      instances of it and if this is a library invocation or a
      specially designed class, then suppress the message with a
      -esym() option.

<td><pre>  Assignment operator for class 'Symbol' does not return a const
      reference to class -- The typical use of an assignment operator
      for class C is to assign new information to variables of class C.
      If this were the entire story there would be no need for the
      assignment operator to return anything.  However, it is
      conventional to support chains of assignment as in:
     
              C x, y, z;
              ...
              x = y = z;
              // parsed as x = (y = z);
     
      For this reason assignment normally returns a reference to the
      object assigned the value.  For example, assignment (y = z) would
      return a reference to y.

      Since it is almost never the case that this variable is to be
      reassigned, i.e. we almost never wish to write:
     
              (x = y) = z;    // unusual
     
      as a general rule it is better to make the assignment operator
      return a const reference.  This will generate a warning when the
      unusual case is attempted.

      But experts differ.  Some maintain that in order to support
      non-const member functions operating directly on the result of an
      assignment as in:
     
              (x = y).mangle();
     
      where, as its name suggests, mangle is non-const it would be
      necessary for the return value of assignment to be non-const.
      Another reason to not insist on the const qualifier is that the
      default assignment operator returns simply a reference to object
      and not a reference to const object.  In an age of generic
      programming, compatibility may more important than the additional
      protection that the const would offer.

<td><pre>  Unqualified name 'Symbol' subject to misinterpretation owing to
      dependent base class -- An unqualified name used within a class
      template was not found within the class and, moreover, the class
      has at least one dependent base class.  There is a potential
      ambiguity here.  According to the standard, the dependent base
      class should not be searched either at template definition time
      or at template instantiation time.  Nonetheless, some
      implementations do make that search at instantiation time.  Even
      if the compiler is conforming, the implementator or even a reader
      of the code may think the base class is searched leading to
      confusion.

      To eliminate the abiguity, the name should be fully qualified (or
      referenced using this).  For example:
     
          class X;
          template&lt; class T &gt;
              class A : T
                  {
                  X *p;
                  bool f() { return y; }
                  };
     
      Both the reference to X (on line 5) and to y (one line 6) will be
      flagged.  One possible modification is:
     
          class X;
          template&lt; class T &gt;
              class A : T
                  {
                  ::X *p;
                  bool f() { return this-&gt;y; }
                  };
     
      This solidifies and disambiguates the code.  The reference to X
      is guaranteed to be the X on line 1 and can no longer be
      high-jacked by the base class.  Also, since y is not a member of
      A, the class will not instantiate unless y is found to be a
      member of the base class.

      const) except that it is issued for a virtual function.  You may
      not want to make virtual functions const because then any
      overriding function would have to be const as well.  Consider,
      for example:
     
            class A { virtual void f( ) {} /* ... */ };
            class B : public A
                { int a; void f( ) { a = 0; } };

      Here, class B overrides A's function f( ) and, in doing so,
      modifies member a.  If A::f( ) had been declared const, this
      would not have been possible.

      Nonetheless, a particularly rigorous user may want to hunt down
